champion: Renekton
role: Top
archetype: bruiser

identity_summary: >
  Renekton is a lane tyrant who plays around Fury management, bursty short
  trades, and wave-tempo control. He spikes at levels 3 and 6 and converts
  wave states into dives/skirmishes. Use burst-and-disengage patterns unless the
  target lacks tools to fight back.

core_strengths:
  - "Elite short-trade burst with empowered W"
  - "Among the strongest level-3 and level-6 champions"
  - "High dive threat with R + Fury + wave setup"
  - "Punishes weak early melee patterns"
  - "Controls lane tempo (freeze/crash at will)"

core_weaknesses:
  - "Falls off if not ahead"
  - "Struggles vs heavy poke/disengage"
  - "Bad into high-armor stackers without Cleaver"
  - "Requires smart Fury + jungle tracking"

trading_pattern:
  fundamentals: >
    Enter trades with Fury for empowered W or Q (or E shred). Core short trade:
    E1 → AA → W(emp) → Q → AA → E2 out. Don’t overstay unless they cannot
    respond or you have big wave advantage. 50+ Fury combo: AA → W(emp)(anim-cancel) → R.
  key_points:
    - "Empowered W is the burst; save Fury for it"
    - "Q/Q(emp) = sustain+push; beware of ganks"
    - "Use double E to enter/exit; keep E2 for escapes when dark"
    - "Track cooldowns; win when mobility is down"

wave_management:
  level_1: >
    Fight for early control. Options:
    (a) Slow push 1–2, crash 3 then crash 4 for recall; or
    (b) Hard trade 1–2, dive on wave-3 with Ignite; or
    (c) Crash 3, trade on wave-4 bounce.
  vs_melees: "Freeze after first crash; force walk-ups into Fury trades"
  vs_ranged: "Thin early; avoid big bounces into poke zone"
  dive_setup: "Stack wave; crash with full Fury → W(emp) → R dive"

jungle_coordination:
  when_you_call_gank:
    - "Freeze near your side with Fury"
    - "E1 to force flash; W to lock"
    - "Time R for dives; tank after key cooldowns"
  when_enemy_ganks:
    - "Hold E2 for disengage"
    - "Play in your wave to W cancel gap closers"
    - "Don’t spam Q on wave when dark"

  lvl3: "Full-combo lethal on most melee"
  lvl6: "Massive dive threat & sustain"
