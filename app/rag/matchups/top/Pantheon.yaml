# Keep this simple so your archetype lookup doesn't get confused.
archetype: engage

summary: >
  Pantheon is an early-game lane dominator who wins through short, guaranteed
  burst windows (Empowered W + Q) and early roam timings with R. Play for level
  2/3 spikes, keep trades short, and use E to nullify key retaliations.

laning_plan:
  - Stack passive with Q poke; all-in when at 3–4 stacks.
  - Take only short trades unless you’re clearly winning.
  - Crash early, then look mid/bot with R when the wave bounces.
  - Hold E for their biggest return damage or gank; don’t waste it for DPS.
  - Manage tempo: shove on advantage, freeze after a bad trade.

trading:
  - 3–4 stacks → W → AA → Q(Emp) → disengage; E if they try to re-engage.
  - Q at max range to stack passive safely and chip.
  - If they gapclose with a key CD, W to interrupt pattern and back off.
  - Use Empowered W → 3x AA when you must commit longer (e.g., with jungler).
  - Be conservative with E; saving it wins fights more than its damage.

runes:
  - Precision: Press the Attack, Triumph, Legend Haste, Last Stand/Coup de Grace
  - Secondary (Resolve): Bone Plating vs all-in / Second Wind vs poke / Overgrowth to scale / Unflinching vs heavy CC
  - Secondary (Sorcery): Manaflow Band, Scorch for aggressive lanes
  - Secondary (Inspiration): Biscuit Delivery, Cosmic Insight (or Jack of All Trades if allowed)
  - Shards: Adaptive Force, Adaptive Force, Flat Health

items:
  - Start: Long Sword + Refillable or Doran’s Blade vs squishies
  - Core: Eclipse, Sundered Sky
  - Alts: Black Cleaver, Spear of Shojin, Stridebreaker, Blade of the Ruined King
  - Boots: Plated Steelcaps / Mercury Treads / Ionian Boots of Lucidity
  - Defensives: Sterak’s Gage, Death’s Dance, Maw of Malmortius, Guardian Angel

checklist:
  - Track level-2 window; set up wave to hit it first.
  - Ward timers: ~2:45 and ~5:00; ping jungler 20s before set-ups.
  - Keep passive stacked before trading or calling gank.
  - After shove, scan mid/bot for R angles before recalling.

skill_tips:
  - Cast E backward to fully negate linear retaliation.
  - Buffer W to cancel some dashes/casts; don’t W into obvious parries.
  - Hide vitals/skillshots with minion waves/terrain when possible.
  - You can ult back to lane to punish plate takes—spear hit often forces Flash.
