champion: Ornn
role: Top
archetype: tank

summary: >
  Ornn is a scaling, low-econ tank who stabilizes lanes and wins games with
  reliable engage and item upgrades. Lane on short, Grasp-based trades and
  brittle procs; avoid extended fights vs sustained DPS. Your job is to
  neutralize early, front-line mid game, and anchor 5v5s late.

laning_plan:
  - Play for short Grasp trades; proc brittle, then disengage.
  - Keep the wave near your tower vs melee; fast push vs ranged to break poke loops.
  - Craft components in lane to sustain and avoid bad recalls.
  - Hold E unless you have wall/pillar setup or clear jungle cover.
  - Save W to deny CC or guarantee a brittle proc on your terms.

trading:
  - Q → W (brittle) → Auto; walk out.
  - Q pillar → E knock-up if they misstep.
  - W through enemy CC to stay Unstoppable and force brittle.
  - Only commit long if jungler is present or their mobility is down.

runes:
  - Resolve: Grasp of the Undying, Demolish, Second Wind/Bone Plating, Overgrowth
  - Inspiration: Biscuit Delivery, Cosmic Insight
  - Shards: Attack Speed, Scaling Health, Flat Health
  - Alt Keystone: Aftershock (when you can’t reliably proc Grasp)

items:
  - Start: Doran’s Shield + Refillable (vs poke) or Doran’s Ring (push) + Refillable
  - Core: Hollow Radiance (AP/neutral), Sunfire Aegis (AD waves), Unending Despair
  - Boots: Plated Steelcaps / Mercury Treads / Ionian Boots of Lucidity
  - Alternatives: Iceborn Gauntlet, Frozen Heart, Heartsteel
  - MR/Anti-burst: Abyssal Mask, Force of Nature, Kaenic Rookern, Spirit Visage
  - Anti-crit: Randuin’s Omen
  - Grievous: Bramble Vest → Thornmail

checklist:
  - Track ward timers ~2:45 and ~5:00; ping ~20s before setup.
  - Hold E for pillar/wall setups; don’t throw it to poke.
  - Play around brittle windows; don’t chase extended.
  - Upgrade ally mythics as soon as you hit 13/14/15/16.

skill_tips:
  - W makes you Unstoppable; time it into enemy CC to keep trading.
  - E only knocks up if you hit terrain — including your Q pillar.
  - Q slows and sets terrain; place slightly behind targets to cut paths.
  - R2 can be buffered to catch flashes/dashes; think two steps ahead.
