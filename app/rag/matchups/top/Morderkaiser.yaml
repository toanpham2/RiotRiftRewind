champion: Mordekaiser
role: Top
archetype: "AP Juggernaut — DPS Bruiser — Duelist — Anti-Carry Isolator"

identity_summary: >
  Mordekaiser is a stat-checking AP juggernaut who excels at extended trades,
  skirmishes, and isolating priority targets with Realm of Death. His laning 
  revolves around slow, inevitable pressure through passive DPS, wave control, 
  and punishing melee champions who cannot escape his zoning. While immobile, 
  his raw numbers, shielding, and sustained damage let him dominate 1v1s and
  front-to-back teamfights when positioned correctly.

core_strengths:
  - "Top-tier extended DPS with three-hit passive"
  - "Very strong in isolated 1v1 once passive + R are active"
  - "Can nullify enemy carry impact with Realm of Death"
  - "Tanky due to W shield + heal"
  - "Amazing level 3 power spike"
  - "Naturally strong vs melee matchups without mobility"
  - "Extremely strong level 6 power spike"

core_weaknesses:
  - "Kiteable; suffers vs range"
  - "Weak pre-3 if poked out"
  - "Telegraphed abilities — E and Q are predictable"
  - "Relies heavily on landing Q and getting passive uptime"
  - "Vulnerable to jungle ganks (no mobility) pre 6"
  - "Can be outscaled by other duelist champions"

trading_pattern:
  fundamentals: >
    Mordekaiser wins through extended trades. Do NOT commit to burst patterns —
    instead, walk forward, land E → Q → auto to proc passive, then stay
    in melee to maximize DPS. against champs that beat you in an extended trade like Tryndamere, Olaf, Darius, etc, Q poke until they are low enough to all in with E -> Q -> auto -> passive extended trade.
  key_patterns:
    - "E → Q -> Auto passive proc"
    - "Use W shield to block key damaging ability"
    - "Use W shield to heal if the shield is not the best option (such as against Renekton) or if you need lane sustain"
    - "E -> R to guarantee the E hit as R very briefly slow the target by 75%"
    - "Stand behind the Target as you ult so the target has less space to move away from you in Death realm, as Death realm spawns different depending on where you are in relation to the target"

wave_management:
  level_1: "Slow push → crash 3rd wave → let cannon wave bounce back to the middle to trade or crash the 4th wave for a recall"
  vs_melee: "Freeze near tower, punish with E pulls"
  vs_range: "Can get wave prio if you hit the wave and enemy with Q, if the wave stacks and is pushing torwards them it's hard for them to poke"
  vs_jungle_pressure: "Keep wave thin and tight to avoid ganks"

jungle_coordination:
  your_jg_ganks:
    - "Pull enemy with E into your jungler"
    - "Walk behind the opponent so they cannot escape"
  enemy_jg_ganks:
    - "Fight 2v2 if Conqueror stacks"
    - "ult the weaker of the 2 enemy if you have r, mostly will win the 1v2 or 2v2"

timing_spikes:
  lvl3: "Strongest early game moment"
  Riftmaker: "Huge power spike for sustained trades"
  2 items: "Becomes unkillable in extended fights"
  lvl6: "Auto-wins most isolated duels, basically un-gankable as long as you have ult, as you can take and win 2 isolated 1v1s"

macro_advice:
  early_game: >
    Thin waves, take short trades, and play for level 3 spike. Land E on key 
    cooldowns ( Renekton dash, Camille hookshot). Keep the wave in a 
    threatening position to maximize pull angles.

  mid_game: >
    Push sides then look for R picks on enemy carries or key teamfight tarkets like a wukong. 
    Mordekaiser becomes terrifying in skirmishes — force fights around dragons 
    and Herald.

  late_game: >
    Identify the highest threat to your team and eliminate them with Realm of Death. 
    Play with patience — flashing after the carry is often game-winning.

common_mistakes:
  - "Sitting on W for too long without using the shield"
  - "Using R early instead of after summoners"
  - "Overpushing without vision"
  - "Using Q before confirming isolation"
  - "overestimating your all in strength against other strong extended fight champions"

feel_good_template: >
  Mordekaiser reflects your unstoppable presence — every Realm of Death you cast 
  shows you carry the same iron will as the Iron Revenant.
