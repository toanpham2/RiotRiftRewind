role: Top
# Keep archetype simple so lookups/coercion are stable.
archetype: bruiser

identity_summary: >
  Aatrox is a sustained-damage lane bully who excels in extended trades,
  spacing-based skirmishing, and executing isolated targets through healing
  resets. He wins with precise Q spacing, wave control, and forcing long fights
  around cooldown windows.

core_strengths:
  - Best-in-class sustain + DPS in extended fights
  - Massive zoning/burst with properly spaced Q1–Q3
  - Excellent dive threat (E mobility + R healing)
  - Thrives in long lanes where spacing matters
  - High snowball potential off one winning trade

core_weaknesses:
  - Can be out-all-in’d by some bruisers
  - Mobile skirmishers can outmaneuver Q windups
  - Grievous Wounds + CC chains reduce impact
  - Predictable Q pattern if poorly spaced

trading_pattern:
  fundamentals: >
    Control space with Q edges, force extended trades, and use E to reposition
    each Q. Stagger Q1–Q3 to match enemy movement; land Q3 sweet spot for burst.
  key_patterns:
    - Q1 → small delay → Q2 (reposition) → E → Q3 finisher
    - Weave autos between Qs (auto-reset)
    - Trade when passive is up for big sustain
    - Use E defensively early; offensively with jungler present
  vs_melee:
    - Punish CS attempts with Q1 edge
    - Auto → Q3 once Bone Plating is down
  vs_range:
    - Farm with Q1/Q2 safely; avoid extended poke
    - Save E strictly to dodge key skillshots

wave_management:
  lvl1:
    - Let wave push toward you to avoid early poke
  lvl3:
    - Fight around Q cooldowns; crash second wave if winning
  lvl4–5:
    - Slow push → build big wave → trade with river control
  mid_game:
    - Create long lane for isolated kills
  late_game:
    - Group when sidelanes are pushed; front-to-back with R or flank and execute carries

jungle_coordination:
  your_jg_ganks:
    - Time E + Q3 with jungler CC to guarantee kill
    - Ping before stacking wave for dive
  enemy_jg_ganks:
    - If you E forward, back off immediately
    - Ward deep brush; you’re vulnerable without E

timing_spikes:
  lvl3: Full Q rotation unlocked — big trading spike
  lvl6: Massive healing + kill pressure with World Ender
  Goredrinker: Core sustain spike for extended fights
  2_items: Peak dueling power
  3_items: Teamfight carry potential

macro_advice:
  early_game: >
    Play around Q spacing and deny enemy short trades. Track junglers carefully
    — you’re vulnerable without E. Manage the wave to create long-lane duels.
  mid_game: >
    Look for skirmishes in river/chokes. You peak on 1–3 items; force fights
    when World Ender is available.
  late_game: >
    Front-to-back with E reposition + Q3 knock-ups, or flank to execute carries.

common_mistakes:
  - Using Q3 without confirming enemy movement
  - Taking extended fights vs stat-checkers (e.g., Jax, Darius) when behind
  - E’ing forward without jungler tracking
  - Trading into CC-heavy windows

feel_good_template: >
  Aatrox isn’t just your weapon — he’s your embodiment of unstoppable pressure.
  Every perfectly spaced Q reminds opponents they’re fighting the Darkin.
