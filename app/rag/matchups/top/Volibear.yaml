champion: Volibear
role: Top
archetype: juggernaut

identity_summary: >
  Volibear is an early–mid game juggernaut specializing in level 3–6 all-ins,
  skirmish dominance, and tower diving. He pressures through Q threat, E zone,
  and W sustain, converting leads into guaranteed dives with R (turret disable).

core_strengths:
  - "One of the strongest level 3–6 all-ins top"
  - "Reliable engage + follow-up CC for ganks"
  - "W sustain + passive AS makes extended fights favorable"
  - "R disables towers for near-guaranteed dives"
  - "Flexible builds: AP bruiser, AD bruiser, or tank"

core_weaknesses:
  - "Kitable by high-mobility/ranged comps"
  - "Predictable engage pathing"
  - "Needs tempo; falls off if behind"

trading_pattern:
  fundamentals: >
    Win through threat pressure and clean ability sequencing. Default short trade:
    Q to force space → E zone lands → W mark → hold W2 for finisher/sustain. Only
    commit long when W2 is reachable or enemy has no escape.
  key_patterns:
    - "Q → (force path) → E under target → W (mark) → autos → W2 to finish"
    - "Q fake to draw cooldowns, re-engage when W up"
    - "Hold W2; it swings fights"
  vs_melee:
    - "Trade often pre-spike; punish CDs with Q"
    - "If E or W2 lands, extend"
  vs_range:
    - "Use brush to hide Q; only commit on misposition"
    - "If spaced/kited, farm safely and thin with E"

wave_management:
  level_1: "Push early with passive + E to hit level 2 first"
  lvl3: "Set up crash for dive; threaten Q → E → W with jungler"
  mid_game: "Stack waves, crash, and dive with R"
  late_game: "Front-to-back; flank if backline is immobile"

jungle_coordination:
  when_you_call_gank:
    - "Ping early; angle Q so flash trade is guaranteed"
    - "Stack wave before dive; drop R to disable tower"
  when_enemy_ganks:
    - "Respect CC chains; you can 1v2 if ahead with W2 + E shield"
    - "Ward early — you naturally push"

timing_spikes:
  lvl2: "Q threat online"
  lvl3: "All-in pattern unlocked"
  lvl6: "Dive windows open with tower disable"
  1_item: "Major spike (Trinity/Riftmaker/Iceborn)"
  2_items: "Skirmish monster"

macro_advice:
  early_game: >
    Push for level 2, take aggressive trades, and look for level 3 all-ins.
    Stack waves to force dives with R. Track junglers—your lane naturally pushes.
  mid_game: >
    Play for side pressure and repeated skirmishes. Crash-dive cycles with
    jungler win games.
  late_game: >
    Front-to-back or flank based on enemy backline mobility. Peel when kited comps
    deny your backline access.

common_mistakes:
  - "Q from too far → kited and CC’d"
  - "Diving without tracking CDs/TPs"
  - "Ulting too late to save dives or start fights"
