champion: Teemo
role: Top
archetype: ranged_bully

identity_summary: >
  Teemo is a lane-dominant ranged bully who wins through spacing, chip damage,
  blind abuse, and wave tempo. He punishes immobile melee champions extremely
  hard, controls brush with traps, and dictates trades through superior
  movement speed. He falls off in coordinated fights but excels at
  neutralizing bruisers, split-pushing, and map control.

core_strengths:
  - "Dominant early laning into melee champions"
  - "Blind shuts down auto-based bruisers (Jax, Tryndamere, Yasuo)"
  - "High poke & chase potential with Move Quick"
  - "Unmatched brush/macro control with shrooms"
  - "Easiest champ in the game to punish bad wave management"
  - "Excellent at holding long lanes"

core_weaknesses:
  - "Very squishy and dies instantly to engages"
  - "Falls off mid–late in 5v5s"
  - "Struggles vs tanks with gap close"
  - "Weak vs heavy sustain bruisers"
  - "Predictable gameplan once ahead"
  - "Requires perfect spacing"

trading_pattern:
  fundamentals: >
    Your laning revolves around spacing, blind timing, and chip damage.
    Abuse Q blind windows to negate all-in attempts while poking with E autos.
  key_patterns:
    - "Auto → Move Quick kite → Auto → back out"
    - "Blind → 2–3 autos while enemy damage is negated"
    - "Use brush control for stealth autos"
  vs_melee:
    - "Punish every CS attempt with auto + E poison"
    - "Use Move Quick to escape all-ins"
  vs_range:
    - "Let wave push to you; avoid extended poke trades"

wave_management:

macro_advice:
  early_game: >
    Abuse range advantage to generate leads. Track jungle at all times and
    avoid pushing without vision. Teemo has immense early zone control.

  mid_game: >
    Use shrooms for area denial. Play side lanes and force enemies to overinvest
    to catch you. Avoid grouped fights unless ahead.

  late_game: >
    Shift from poke to trap-based zoning. Your power comes from flanks,
    Blind timings, and catching mispositions — not front-to-back fights.

common_mistakes:
  - "Pushing without vision → free ganks"
  - "Burning Blind too early"
  - "Fighting extended vs tanks"
  - "Overcommitting to kills instead of wave priority"

feel_good_template: >
  Teemo mirrors your cunning — every poke, every trap shows you win through
  superior strategy and flawless spacing.
