summary: >
  Jax is a hyper-scaling duelist who controls trades around Counter Strike.
  Play short, winning windows early, then take long lanes and side-lane once
  you hit Sheen → Trinity spikes.

laning_plan:
  - Contest level 1 with E only if safe; otherwise last-hit to 2/3.
  - Take short, scripted trades around E; don’t commit Q first.
  - Crash on Sheen timing; freeze when behind or vs heavy burst.
  - Default to long lane after Trinity to pressure sidelane.

trading:
  - Lead with movement → E → (Q if needed) → AA → W reset → stun to end.
  - Never Q first unless their dash is down or kill is guaranteed.
  - Ward-jump with Q to escape or extend.
  - Versus melee: short trades if they win extended; otherwise stack passive and run long.
  - Versus ranged: don’t fight pre-3; use brush for grasp/W taps.

runes:
  - Lethal Tempo, Triumph, Legend: Alacrity, Last Stand
  - Secondary (Resolve): Demolish, Second Wind (or Unflinching vs CC)
  - Shards: Attack Speed, Adaptive Force, Armor/MR
  - Alt page (vs short-trade lanes): Grasp of the Undying + Demolish/Second Wind, Secondary Inspiration (Biscuits, Cosmic Insight)

items:
  - Start: Doran’s Blade or Doran’s Shield vs poke
  - Core: Trinity Force → Sundered Sky
  - Alts: Nashor’s Tooth, Wit's End, Ravenous Hydra, Blade of the Ruined King (vs HP tanks/ Sion)
  - Boots: Plated Steelcaps / Mercury Treads / Ionian Boots of Lucidity
  - Defense: Frozen Heart, Sterak’s Gage, Death’s Dance, Zhonya’s (tech)

checklist:
  - Track E cooldowns on both sides; never waste E into nothing.
  - Hold Q for gap-close/escape; ward-jump is your panic button.
  - Fight on Sheen/Trinity timings; ping jungler 20s before setup.
  - Maintain long lane after first item; force isolated fights.

skill_tips:
  - Weave W to proc Sheen; W range is longer than AA.
  - Buffer Q during E to arrive as stun lands.
  - Save E to block key on-hit/auto windows (Renekton W, Volibear Q/W).
  - Use brush to break Teemo vision and deny blind uptime.

  - "Lvl2: empowered trades and auto resets"
  - "Lvl3: full combo online"
  - "Sheen: massive damage spike on W"
